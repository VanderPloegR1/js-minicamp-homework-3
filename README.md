# Homework #3

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Objects - An object is like someones last name. They are part of a faamily you still need their first name (the properties) to locate specifically the person in the family you are looking for. And then each person has a specific value, or piece of information.
	* Properties - Properties are like the first names is the previous example. They are all located within a family (last name, and objects)
	* Methods - Methods are inside objects, but instead of bieng a single  value or string, they are like a set of instructions(a little peice of code that is executed).
	* for in loop - This is a loop that repeats, but it goes through and for each property of an object, or in other words it will follow the same instructions and apply it to every person who has the same last name, to be consistent with the previous example.
	* dot notation vs bracket notation - Dot notation is like using a specific number in a math equation, bracket notation is like using a variable like x where you don't know the value yet, and later you can instert the specific number.
